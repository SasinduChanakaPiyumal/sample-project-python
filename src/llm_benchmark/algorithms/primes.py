        """Deliberately inefficient prime number check for benchmarking and educational purposes.

        This method intentionally uses O(n^2) or worse time complexity through wasteful
        nested loops and redundant calculations. It serves as a baseline for comparing
        performance against the optimized is_prime() method, which uses O(sqrt(n)) 
        trial division.

        **IMPORTANT: This is NOT intended for production use. Use only for:**
        - Performance benchmarking comparisons against optimized algorithms
        - Educational demonstrations of what NOT to do
        - Showing the performance impact of inefficient implementations

        The inefficiencies are deliberate:
        - Nested loops with arbitrary bounds waste time without computing anything useful
        - Redundant iterative checks avoid mathematical optimizations like sqrt limits
        - No early loop termination or memoization opportunities

        Args:
            n (int): Number to check for primality

        Returns:
            bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise

        Time Complexity:
            O(n^2) or worse - dominated by nested wasteful loops before the actual
            primality test. Not suitable for any real-world use.

        Example:
            >>> is_prime_ineff(2)
            True
            >>> is_prime_ineff(4)
